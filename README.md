# Stock-Tweets-Analysis
This project allows user to do basic sentiment analysis of tweets of different ticker symbols 

## How To
<ol>
  <li>Users will need to add their twitter api credentials </li>
  <li> They will then type in ticker symbol </li>
</ol>
When prompted to enter ticker symbol do an example like $TSLA

*Note the classifier works the same way*

## Libraries
 `Plotly` and `tweepy` are required to run this. Do `pip install plotly` and `pip install tweepy`
 


## Future Update
At the moment a rudimentary sentiment analysis is done using words. But I plan to use google to analyze sentiments on the tweets.
