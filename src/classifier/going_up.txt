internals relative strength 
FULLY COMPLIANT! Take advantage of this dip it will NOT last much longer 
Hard at work! Be Strong, Stay Long! 
I see them going up 
As expected a nice bounce starting on these after I called caution. Don’t hate me as I’m not a bear. Just understand that slight pullbacks after parabolic actually help  
Looking for another long entry 
We waiting for long time , just do it , produce and sell that’s the game 
has tons of strong investors 
amazing! go 
Is gonna moon so hard that I’m lost for words 
At the rate they're growing, they'll be $200-300+ in a matter of maybe a few years. Time is running out to buy before they take-off.  
Sooner. The fact is each earnings surpassed there by summer time. 
So crazy
This is going to rocket
